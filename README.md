description: This project demonstrates how to perform data integration in Power BI by combining datasets from multiple data sources—specifically, an Excel file and a SQL Server database—into a single, unified Power BI report. The goal is to show how organizations can bring together disparate data to gain deeper insights and make data-driven decisions.
